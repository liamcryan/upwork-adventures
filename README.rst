ADVENTURES IN UPWORK
--------------------


With very little cheekiness, I would like to publicly
catalog my experiences in Upwork.  Some initial
excitement quickly fled once I realized getting
work was not so simple, and some fake companies are trying
to scam you.

Experience Number 1

The ad asked to scrape details from 175 lawyers and
save the results into an excel file.  The lawyers were
split up into 9 pages (think pagination).  Each lawyer had
a follow-through link with the details of that specific
lawyer - the exact details that needed to be input to
the excel file.

My thinking: I have used requests-html for my past few
scraping projects and wanted to try something new.  The
url structure made me think a spider would work, so I
thought I'd try out Scrapy.  I didn't want to 'make a
proposal' to the job poster until I had at least a little
bit of Scrapy under my belt - a couple hours later, I
had the basics and finished the project.  All that was
left to do was let the job poster know I was interested,
get accepted for the job and then wait an hour or two and
send the file I have already generated.

This approach to consulting is not a good one - but
if you want to learn a new library, this approach might
be fun.  The experience was fun - I am more comfortable
use Scrapy and am a little more worldly for it.
